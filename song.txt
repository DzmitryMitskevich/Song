Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells

Sometimes you love her
Sometimes you don't
Sometimes you need it then you don't and you let go

Sometimes we rush it
Sometimes we fall
It doesn't matter baby, we can take it real slow

'Cause the way that we touch is something that we can't deny
And the way that you move oh you make me feel alive
Come on
Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells
